/*
 * SN74HC165N_shift_reg
 *
 * Program to shift in the bit values from a SN74HC165N 8-bit
 * parallel-in/serial-out shift register.
 *
 * This sketch demonstrates reading in 16 digital states from a
 * pair of daisy-chained SN74HC165N shift registers while using
 * only 4 digital pins on the Arduino.
 *
 * You can daisy-chain these chips by connecting the serial-out
 * (Q7 pin) on one shift register to the serial-in (Ds pin) of
 * the other.
 * 
 * Of course you can daisy chain as many as you like while still
 * using only 4 Arduino pins (though you would have to process
 * them 4 at a time into separate unsigned long variables).
